.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
With the 
.Nm
command, the extended attributes of one or more files may be listed, written (set), printed (displayed), or deleted.  
.Pp
Extended attributes allow the arbitrary association of name:data pairs with file system objects (file, directories, symbolic links, et cetera).  The name of an extended attribute may be any null-terminated UTF-8 string.  The data associated with it may be either textual or binary.
.Pp
This implimentation of the 
.Nm
command is designed to be backwards-compatible with the version that shipped with Macintosh OS 10.5.0 (Leopard).  The display format has been changed slightly for use in shell scripts.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
lists the extended attributes associate with the object at the specified path.  Alternate behavior is triggered by the use of a command flag.
.Sh COMMANDS

.It Fl p
Display (print) the value of a given extended attribute.
.It Fl d

.Sh BUGS              \" Document known, unremedied bugs
This implimentation of the xattr command was written by a computer hobbyist;  the source code has not, to date, been reviewed by an experienced C programmer.
Apple currently (as of OS X 10.5.1) advises that the names of extended attributes be limited to 750 characters.
