Copyright header at top of file.

Leave another blank line before the header files.
Non-local includes in angle brackets.
Kernel include files (i.e. sys/*.h) come first;
Leave a blank line before the next group, the framework and /usr include files, which should be sorted alphabetically by name.
Leave another blank line before the user include files.
Local includes in double quotes.

Space after keywords (if, while, for, return, switch).  No braces are
     used for control statements with zero or only a single statement unless
     that statement is more than a single line in which case they are permit-
     ted.  Forever loops are done with for's, not while's.

Variable names should contain underscores to separate words.

Do not add whitespace at the end of a line, and only use tabs followed by spaces to form the indentation.  Do not use more spaces than a tab will produce and do not use spaces in front of tabs.

Closing and opening braces go on the same line as the else.  Braces that are not necessary may be left out.

No spaces after function names.  Commas have a space after them.  No spaces after `(' or `[' or preceding `]' or `)' characters.

Use err(3) or warn(3), do not roll your own.

Main should be
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
(getopt shuffles argv)

Use getopt_long or getopt_long_only; provide at least --help and --version.

Use climac_version_info(); to print standard copyright information -- if copyright belongs to lipidity.com
else use custom_version_info(...)
